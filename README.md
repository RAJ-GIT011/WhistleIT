# 🕵️‍♂️ WhistleIT

> A decentralized, anonymous, and collaborative whistleblower platform powered by Solana.

WhistleIT is a secure platform that empowers individuals to report misconduct, corruption, or injustice anonymously — and enables others to contribute to the same case to build stronger evidence trails. NGOs, journalists, and authorities can request access to verified reports based on the whistleblower's consent.

## 📝 How It Works

1. **User logs in** via Phantom Wallet (no sign-up needed).
2. **Submits a case** anonymously with metadata + optional proof.
3. Others can **see minimal info** and **contribute if relevant**.
4. NGOs/Journalists can **request access** and chat with the original whistleblower (only if granted).
5. Community can **upvote/downvote** to highlight serious cases.

## 🎯 Vision

WhistleIT aims to bring **transparency**, **protection**, and **collaboration** to those who speak up against injustice — without putting themselves at risk. It’s like Reddit for whistleblowing, but **secure, decentralized, and built for impact.**
